<p>I am supposed to be filling a page with content, telling a story,
but nothing is coming to mind. So instead I am going to just stream of
conscious what is going on in my mind. </p>
</div>

<p>I should tell about myself, things like that I spent my pre high
school
years living in inner St. Louis, moving every year, always the new kid
in school. </p>

<article>
</article>
<p>Then in time for high school I moved to Times Beach MO. A big change
in
environment, as there were woods 100yds from my house, the Merimac
river a half mile away. Spent lots of time fishing, swimming, and
exploring. And then in my 4th year of high school they discovered we
had been contaminated with dioxon. While they were trying to figure out
what to do about it, the river had a 500 yr flood, the entire town was
under 10' or more of water for 3 days. The entire town was declared a
disaster area, the Federal government bought us all out, and we
scattered to the 4 winds. Never reconnected with most of my friends
from that time period. </p>

Eventually my family wound up in a house in Maplewood. I knew no one in
the area. Wasn't going to school, didn't have a job, so meeting new
folks was just running into people while walking my dog around the
area, or riding my bike. Eventually met some local kids, started having
friends again. <br>

Friends, girlfriends, jobs... life in general for some time. Discovered
Science Fiction and gaming conventions. <br>

<br>

Switched from working 3 seasonal jobs (Taxes, grass cutting, Xmas rush
factory work) to being a trucker. Spent a year doing it with my
girlfriend, then we broke up. Hit 47 states, and most of Canada. After
a couple of years of over the road stuff I started working more local
stuff, met a woman. <br>

<br>

She changed my life. Got me involved in to Live Action Role Playing
(Kind of improvisational acting... on a national scale), and some how
got me to start volunteering for stuff. Ran 2 local monthly
newsletters, and started volunteering at conventions. The more I did,
the more people gave me more responsibility. Then she convinced me to
stop trucking, and look at office work, something that would make me
use my brain more. <br>

<br>

After a couple temp jobs, I got hired at the place she works. 17yrs
later, still there. Went from stuffing envelopes to the position I've
held for 7 years, hiring trainers nationwide for over 1000
trainings/yr, getting materials where they need to go, playing with
databases, and solving problems. <br>

<br>

I've also spent the last 20 years helping run conventions, from small
200 people things, to being staff for big ones like GenCon and StarWars
Celebration. It has managed to get me to Germany and England so far. <br>

<br>

Opened a booth at the St. Louis Renaissance&nbsp; Faire, built a
24'x24' 2-story building, learned to like wearing tights and acting
like an idiot in the street. Helped out with the Merchant committee,
and building committee. <br>

<br>

Somewhere in all that got married to the woman who changed my life,
spent 9 days in ICU, helped kids grow up, built some webpages, played a
lot with an opensource program called Tiddlywiki, met tons of people,
learned tons of random stuff, became the guy people ask "Is this
true?", spent time kayaking in MO, started attending Burning Man type
events, and just living a life that makes me happy.&nbsp; <br>
