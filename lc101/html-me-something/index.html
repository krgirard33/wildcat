                    <h2>The Start</h2>
                    <p>I am supposed to be filling a page with content, telling a story, but nothing is coming to mind. So instead I am going to just stream of conscious what is going on in my mind, and hope it flows into something.

                    <h2>School Years</h2>
                    <p>I should tell about myself, things like that I spent my pre high school years living in inner St. Louis, moving every year, always the new kid in school.</p>
                    <p>Then in time for high school I moved to Times Beach MO. A big change in environment, as there were woods 100yds from my house, the Meramec river a half mile away. Spent lots of time fishing, swimming, and exploring. And then in my
                        4th year of high school they discovered we had been contaminated with dioxon. While they were trying to figure out what to do about it, the river had a 500 yr flood, the entire town was under 10' or more of water for 3 days. The
                        entire town was declared a disaster area, the Federal government bought us all out, and we scattered to the 4 winds. Never reconnected with most of my friends from that time period.</p>

                    <h2>20s</h2>
                    <p>Eventually my family wound up in a house in Maplewood. I knew no one in the area. Wasn't going to school, didn't have a job, so meeting new folks was just running into people while walking my dog around the area, or riding my bike.
                        Eventually met some local kids, started having friends again. </p>

                    <p>Friends, girlfriends, jobs... life in general for some time. Discovered Science Fiction and gaming conventions. </p>

                    <p>Switched from working 3 seasonal jobs (Taxes, grass cutting, Xmas rush factory work) to being a trucker. Spent a year doing it with my girlfriend, then we broke up. Hit 47 states, and most of Canada. After a couple of years of over
                        the road stuff I started working more local stuff, met a woman. </p>

                    <h2>30s+</h2>
                    <p>She changed my life. Got me involved in to Live Action Role Playing (Kind of improvisational acting... on a national scale), and some how got me to start volunteering for stuff. Ran 2 local monthly newsletters, and started volunteering
                        at conventions. The more I did, the more people gave me more responsibility. Then she convinced me to stop trucking, and look at office work, something that would make me use my brain more. </p>

                    <p>After a couple temp jobs, I got hired at the place she works. 17yrs later, still there. Went from stuffing envelopes to the position I've held for 7 years, hiring trainers nationwide for over 1000 trainings/yr, getting materials where
                        they need to go, playing with databases, and solving problems.</p>

                    <p>I've also spent the last 20 years helping run conventions, from small 200 people things, to being staff for big ones like GenCon and StarWars Celebration. It has managed to get me to Germany and England so far. </p>

                    <p>Opened a booth at the St. Louis Renaissance Faire, built a 24'x24' 2-story building, learned to like wearing tights and acting like an idiot in the street. Helped out with the Merchant committee, and building committee. </p>

                    <p>Somewhere in all that got married to the woman who changed my life, spent 9 days in ICU, helped kids grow up, built some webpages, played a lot with an opensource program called Tiddlywiki, met tons of people, got a lot of interesting
                        stories, learned tons of random stuff, became the guy people ask "Is this true?", spent time kayaking in MO, started attending Burning Man type events, and just living a life that makes me happy. .</p>

                    <h1>The Future</h1>
                    <p>Learning coding at LaunchCode, hoping it opens some new opportunities, and at the very least it gives me new skills. The wife is looking at changing jobs, hoping to get a new gig working as the director of a convention, which would
                        hopefully mean I can take risk again, jobwise.</p>
